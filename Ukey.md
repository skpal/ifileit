# What is ukey #

**ukey** is a 6 or 7 character alphanumeric (a-z 0-9) "unique key" for each file on the ifile.it system, knowing they ukey allows you to construct the download URL for the file

An ifile.it download URL comes in 2 formats, for example:
```
http://ifile.it/6phxv2z
http://ifile.it/6phxv2z/Internet_map_1024.jpg
```

Where <b>6phxv2z</b> is the ukey for the example file above.

The first URL is a short link while the second URL above is an extended and more descriptive version of the first URL, both point to the same file and you can use either depending on your preference!
